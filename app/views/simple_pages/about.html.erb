      <h2 class="sub-header kanit-3 mb3">At Euro Bike Tours, we specialise in crafting memorable travel experiences across the European continent.</h2>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">We were founded in 2018, after a group of travel addicts and cycling enthusiasts noticed the lack of options for organised, multi-destination cycle travel.</p>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">Our aim is to make cycle tours accessible to all, whatever your ability, fitness level, or budget. We believe that travelling is as much about the journey as the destination, and there is no better way to experience the wonders of Europe than on two wheels.</p>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">The freedom is unparalleled, and the excitement ever-present. We are passionate about what we do, and we hope you will take the next step on your travelling adventures with us!</p>

      <h2 class="sub-header kanit-3 mb3">We've been around the block, so we know a thing or two about organising a cycling trip...</h2>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">From the rolling Tuscan hills to the windswept flats of the Netherlands, we pride ourselves on our ability to create just about any imaginable itinerary.</p>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">Our team has extensive experience of cycling on the continent. If you book a tour with us, you won't find yourself at the roadside with a flat tyre and a soaking wet map written in a foreign language. You will receive a comprehensive pre-tour package, with guidance on everything from local customs, to cycling etiquette, and even the best coffee stops along the way!</p>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">After many years of cycling around Europe, we established a vast network of friends and travel buddies who in turn became our trusted business partners. We have links with local bike shops, cafes, and accommodation, so you will never be too far away from a friendly face.</p>

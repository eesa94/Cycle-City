      <h2 class="sub-header kanit-3 mb3">At Euro Bike Tours, we specialise in crafting memorable travel experiences across the European continent.</h2>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">We were founded in 2018, after a group of travel addicts and cycling enthusiasts noticed the lack of options for organised, multi-destination cycle travel.</p>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">Our aim is to make cycle tours accessible to all, whatever your ability, fitness level, or budget. We believe that travelling is as much about the journey as the destination, and there is no better way to experience the wonders of Europe than on two wheels.</p>
      <p class="default-text kanit-3">The freedom is unparalleled, and the excitement ever-present. We are passionate about what we do, and we hope you will take the next step on your travelling adventures with us!</p>
